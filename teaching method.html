TEACHING METHODOLOGY</p>
<p class="d">Every journey begins with a small stem. In learning that step is attention. At Sakthi Vigneshwara Kalvi Nilayam we believe that learning is an interactive process wherein each student has a different disposition towards knowledge and hence, learns differently. Our classes are small enough to allow the teachers to personalize the curriculum to make a child learn the way he or she enjoys. Here a student is not a roll number but a distinct individual with his / her own uniqueness, strengths, weaknesses and cultural diversity.

We believe in creating an interactive and entertaining environment that stuimulates the desire to be inquisitive and to learn new skills and concepts. Since we are trusted by parents of not only the multicultural Indian Society but also a diverse international community, we practice a student – cent red approach enriched with activities that develop imagination, thinking and creative skills. Personal care and attention are the key words in Sakthi Vigneshwara Kalvi Nilayam.
